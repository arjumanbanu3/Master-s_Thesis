## Master's Thesis: Global Groundwater Recharge


#### In my master's thesis, I am analyzing the ralation between groundwater recharge, climate and water-table depth in a globa-scale recharge and precipitation intensity dataset. In my project, first I tested the statistical relationships between groundwater gecharge and different climatic variables, soil parameters, and precipitation intensity parameters. After that, I implemented several models such as, liner regression, sigmoid function model, and polynomial model,  and mechine learning methods ( Multi-linear regression, Random Forest, Neural Network) to predict global groundwater recharge. Since groundwater recharge is a complex process and not only depend on one variable but the thelationship is non-linear. Thus, it would be realistic to depend on several models to predict the global grouldwater recharge.

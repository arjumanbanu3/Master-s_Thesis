## Master's Thesis: Global Groundwater Recharge


#### In my masterâ€™s thesis, I analyzed the relationship between groundwater recharge, climate variables, and measurement methods using a global-scale dataset on recharge and precipitation intensity. The study began by examining statistical correlations between groundwater recharge and various climatic variables, soil characteristics, and precipitation intensity parameters.

#### Subsequently, I implemented a range of predictive models, including linear regression, sigmoid functions, and polynomial models, alongside machine learning techniques such as Random Forest and Neural Networks. These approaches were chosen to capture the complex and often non-linear nature of groundwater recharge processes, which are influenced by more than just climatic variables.

#### The findings highlighted that groundwater recharge is strongly dependent on climatic factors such as precipitation, temperature seasonality, and aridity. However, topographic features (e.g., digital elevation model values) and soil properties (e.g., silt content) also identified as significant predictors. These results underscore the importance of using a combination of modeling approaches to more accurately estimate global groundwater recharge.
